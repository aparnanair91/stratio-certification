# stratio-certification - Final Usecase submission by Aparna Nair

To build an application that will be used by banks, which will filter good and bad client credit scores when receiving a credit request from the user. A prediction will be produced for each request hitting the application in a near real-time fashion. The credit risk can be identified from the predictions made. As an addition the predictions are labelled as Red, Green and Yellow to denote the credit scores. 

There are four folders:
1. Data - It has all input datasets used for the usecase
2. Documentation - End to end documentation of components
3. Notebooks - Python notebooks used to build the model in the intelligence environment
4. Sparta - The workflow which uses the risk prediction model for any dataset.
